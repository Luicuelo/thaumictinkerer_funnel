# thaumictinkerer_funnel
Modified thaumictinkerer funnel


Thaumic Tinkerer modifications for use with jars with a capacity greater than 250, and enhancements to facilitate automation. The essence level in the ‘jar’ can now be measured with a comparator, allowing for detection when it has been completely emptied. Additionally, applying a redstone signal to the funnel will now transfer its contents to the hopper located beneath it.

You can detect when the jar is empty and is replaced with another."
